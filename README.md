# get_next_line42

## Description:

This repository contains an implementation of the get_next_line function, a custom file-reading function written in C. The purpose of this function is to read a line from a file descriptor until a newline character ('\n') is encountered, or the end of the file is reached. This project serves as an assignment/project requirement for 42 Network or similar programming courses.

## Key Features:

Implementation of the get_next_line function in C, compliant with the specified requirements of the assignment.
Handles reading input line by line, dynamically allocating memory for each line read.
Manages file descriptors, reads data from files, and correctly handles newline characters.
Addresses edge cases, such as reading from multiple file descriptors, empty lines, or reaching the end of the file.
## Purpose:

Designed for educational purposes, demonstrating proficiency in file I/O operations, memory management, and handling pointers in the C programming language.
Demonstrates the ability to create a robust and efficient function that meets specific project requirements.
Encourages best practices in coding, including code readability, modularity, and documentation.
## Usage:

Clone the repository and compile the provided code using a C compiler.
Include the get_next_line function in your C projects to read lines from file descriptors.
## Note:

This repository is a project assignment and may contain solutions specific to course requirements.
Contributions, improvements, or suggestions are welcome.
